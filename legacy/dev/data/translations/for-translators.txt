The way weekdaymasses.org.uk is translated is very simple. We have a database
of churches, the areas they're in, the times of their masses and various other
pieces of information.  To present all that data, we include it in a web page
surrounded by some text which tells the website user what the data is about and
what to do: "This is a list of Weekday Masses in East Anglia" or "Click below".
Each of those pieces of text quoted above is represented by a short keyphrase:
area_weekday_masses or general_click_below. This keyphrase has a translation
into each of the languages we offer -- including English. 

In some cases, the translation is straightforward. "Click below" doesn't need
anything other than presenting text of the same meaning in Portuguese, French
etc. In other cases, such as the "This is a list..." text above, certain of the
words will depend on what the website user has selected. So they may be looking
at a list of Sunday Masses in East Anglia, or Weekday Masses in Kent. In that
case, the translation needs to leave room for the words which will change. The
placeholders for those changing words are surrounded by curly brackets:

  This is a list of {{day}} Masses in {{area}}

The text inside the curly brackets *should not be translated*. The only thing a
translator should do is to move the curly brackets around so that the
corresponding piece of data ("Sunday", "East Anglia") will fall in the correct
place in the sentence structure.

The other oddity you will come across is text surrounded by square brackets:

  Select from a list of Masses by [GB Postcode]

The text inside the square brackets will become a link for the user to click
on to take them to the appropriate page. Therefore, the text inside the
square brackets *should be translated* although it may be necessary to
change exactly which text is bracketed according to a particular language.

Finally, a note on the .xls files. Each language has is own .xls file called
translations.<ll>.xls where <ll> is the two-letter abbreviation for that
language. The .xls has only one sheet, also named for the language's two-letter
abbreviation. The program which extracts the translations only cares about the
first two columns: anything after that can be used for notes, for keeping the
English translation or simply left blank.

I've used the .xls format because it's widely readable/writeable and -- and this
is a key point -- because it makes character set issues easier to handle. That
said, I can work with absolutely any data format you can provide. If it's easier
for you to produce a Word document or an Open Office ODT file or a text file from
notepad or an HTML file -- I can transform it very easily into the format I need.

Let me say this quite clearly: if you any difficulties in doing this (apart from
actual translation where I probably can't help!) make it my problem. I can overcome
pretty much any technical / format problem you care to throw at me far more easily
that you can, so if there are technical or operational difficulties don't get
bogged down by them: just throw them back at me. I'm immensely grateful to you
for helping out in this way, and I'll do whatever it takes to make your path
smoother.

The current version of your translation will always be available at:

  http://svn.weekdaymasses.org.uk/trunk/data/translations/translations.<ll>.xls

and I'll normally upload your latest translation to:

  http://dev.weekdaymasses.org.uk/

(note the dev subdomain) for you to go over and check in situ before
we push them live. On that site, you can also see the "raw" language.
This is a pseudo language which, if you select it, shows you the
keyphrases -- the ones you're translating against -- which underly
the website.
