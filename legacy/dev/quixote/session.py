"""quixote.session

Quixote session management.  There are two levels to Quixote's
session management system:
  - SessionManager
  - Session

A SessionManager is responsible for creating sessions, setting and reading
session cookies, maintaining the collection of all sessions, and so forth.
There is one SessionManager instance per Quixote process.

A Session is the umbrella object for a single session (notionally, a (user,
host, browser_process) triple).  Simple applications can probably get away
with putting all session data into a Session object (or, better, into an
application-specific subclass of Session).

The default implementation provided here is not persistent: when the
Quixote process shuts down, all session data is lost.  See
doc/session-mgmt.txt for information on session persistence.

    SessionManager acts as a dictionary of all sessions, mapping session
    ID strings to individual session objects.  Session objects are
    instances of Session (or a custom subclass for your application).
    SessionManager is also responsible for creating and destroying
    sessions, for generating and interpreting session cookies, and for
    session persistence (if any -- this implementation is not
    persistent).

    Most applications can just use this class directly; sessions will
    be kept in memory-based dictionaries, and will be lost when the
    Quixote process dies.  Alternatively an application can subclass
    SessionManager to implement specific behaviour, such as persistence.
