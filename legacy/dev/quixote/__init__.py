    Installs the import hooks needed to import PTL modules.  This must
    be done explicitly because not all Quixote applications need to use
    PTL, and import hooks are deep magic that can cause all sorts of
    mischief and deeply confuse innocent bystanders.  Thus, we avoid
    invoking them behind the programmer's back.  One known problem is
