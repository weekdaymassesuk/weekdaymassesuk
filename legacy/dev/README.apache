* Install Apache in the usual way

* git init; git add .; git commit -m "Initial state"

* Include extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

* In extra/httpd-vhosts.conf, create a default and an entry like so:

<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "C:/Users/tim/work-in-progress/weekdaymasses.org.uk/branches/mapsv3"
    ServerName "local.weekdaymasses.org.uk"
    ErrorLog "logs/weekdaymasses.log"
    CustomLog "logs/weekdaymasses.log" common
</VirtualHost>

* In httpd.conf, uncomment mod_vhost_alias.so and mod_rewrite.so

* Add a directory entry for weekdaymasses, like so:

<Directory "C:/Users/tim/work-in-progress/weekdaymasses.org.uk/branches/mapsv3">
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI
    AllowOverride All
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

* Look for "AddHandler cgi-script .cgi" and enable it

That's it, unless I've forgotten something
