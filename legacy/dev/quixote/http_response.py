class HTTPResponse:
    """
    An object representation of an HTTP response.

    The Response type encapsulates all possible responses to HTTP
    requests.  Responses are normally created by the Quixote publisher
    or by the HTTPRequest class (every request must have a response,
    after all).

    Instance attributes:
      status_code : int
        HTTP response status code (integer between 100 and 599)
      reason_phrase : string
        the reason phrase that accompanies status_code (usually
        set automatically by the set_status() method)
      headers : { string : string }
        most of the headers included with the response; every header set
        by 'set_header()' goes here.  Does not include "Status" or
        "Set-Cookie" headers (unless someone uses set_header() to set
        them, but that would be foolish).
      body : string
        the response body, None by default.  If the body is never
        set (ie. left as None), the response will not include
        "Content-type" or "Content-length" headers.  These headers
        are set as soon as the body is set (with set_body()), even
        if the body is an empty string.
      buffered : bool
        if false, response data will be flushed as soon as it is
        written (the default is true).  This is most useful for
        responses that use the Stream() protocol.  Note that whether the
        client actually receives the partial response data is highly
        dependent on the web server
      cookies : { name:string : { attrname : value } }
        collection of cookies to set in this response; it is expected
        that the user-agent will remember the cookies and send them on
        future requests.  The cookie value is stored as the "value"
        attribute.  The other attributes are as specified by RFC 2109.
      cache : int | None
        the number of seconds the response may be cached.  The default is 0,
        meaning don't cache at all.  This variable is used to set the HTTP
        expires header.  If set to None then the expires header will not be
        added.
      javascript_code : { string : string }
        a collection of snippets of JavaScript code to be included in
        the response.  The collection is built by calling add_javascript(),
        but actually including the code in the HTML document is somebody
        else's problem.
